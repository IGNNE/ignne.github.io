		<p>The first flight with the new motor, and the first one I can call a flight without quotation marks!</p>

<p>Sadly, the video recording bugged out again. For the last flight, I switched to just recording the laptop screen, but then the video <em>transmission</em> died. I guess fate doesn’t want me to show a video here, sorry. Here is the result of the screen recording:</p>
<p><video controls="" src="/images/flug-cut.mp4" style="width:70.0%"><a href="/images/flug-cut.mp4">Video</a></video></p>
<p>Also, the last <del>crash</del> landing of the day broke the backbone, of course right <em>behind</em> the part that I strengthened for the new motor. If any real bones ever look like the thing in the picture, go call a doctor.</p>
<p><img src="/images/plane-broken.png" style="width:30.0%"/></p>
<p>Apart from that minor setback, I am going to call this a partial success. It (finally) flies, but it also showed some issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>I made a few short flights, with the longest consisting of several rather large laps around the meadow. It obviously works.</li>
<li>The new power train provides more than enough thrust. I think it uses about 40 W at full throttle, and the battery went from 4,1 V / cell to only around 3,9 V / cell in roughly 30 minutes of testing (in other words, lots of energy left).</li>
<li>With all the new weight, the required airspeed to avoid stalls seems to be quite high. I don’t know how accurate the speed estimation from the IMU is, but from my gut feeling, it needs maybe 20-25 km/h to stay controllable.</li>
<li>I borrowed an XBox controller from a friend, which works surprisingly well. I believe it would have been almost impossible to control the plane with only the touch screen controls.</li>
<li>The plane is really hard to control without IMU stabilization. The one time that I tried to steer it in manual mode was a constant struggle to avoid crashing. I have a few theories:</li>
<li>First, the airframe is not made with high stability in mind. There are vibrations, it can twist quite a bit, and I think I need to “calibrate” the weight and drag a bit more (it constantly pulled to one side).</li>
<li>The WifiBroadcast transmission does not work too well. I feel like everything worked better at the beginning and got worse over time, so maybe it just caught some water. But in the one partial video I could recover, you can see that the attitude updates stutter <em>a lot</em>. This, combined with the first point, makes it pretty hard to appropriately compensate for wind gusts and non-ideal weight distribution.</li>
<li>I am not 100% happy with the IMU, too. I might have to tune the low-pass filters or something.</li>
<li><em>By the way, did I tell you that I have never really flown an RC plane or multicopter before?</em></li>
</ul>
