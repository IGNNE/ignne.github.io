    <p><p>Äcktshually the second flight in 2022, I was just to lazy to write two articles. Nice weather. Here’s a short clip:</p>
<p><video controls="" src="/images/flug2202-cut.mp4" style="width:70.0%"><a href="/images/flug2202-cut.mp4">Video</a></video></p>
<p>Main takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>With everything screwed in place and properly set up, stabilization is rock solid. It feels like flying on rails. On one flight, I broke the …</li></ul></p>

<li>After the crash in flight number 4, I replaced the whole backbone with a more durable spruce bar, which brought the weight up quite a bit. Despite this, it now flies way more stable.</li>
<li>The new wifi setup is a lot better. It feels way more responsive, and I had …</li></ul></p>

<p>Sadly, the video recording bugged out again. For the last flight, I switched to just recording the laptop screen, but then the video <em>transmission</em> died. I guess fate doesn’t want …</p></p>

    <p><p>I glued everything together, it seems to work so far. I also moved back the CG and tuned the PWM frequency and max value. I didn’t measure it, but I think I’m around 3-4 A at 5 V, which really is the limit for, well, pretty much everything …</p></p>

    <p><p>Slightly warmer, almost no wind. This time with the barometer. Still no flying. Here, have a pretty sunset instead. Same configuration as the first flight.</p>

<p>Anyway, a negative result is a result as well. At least I have a reason to go outside in these weird times.</p>

    <p><p>Around 4°C, a little bit of wind. This flight was done without the barometer, using the simple sensor fusion module. This was the oldest configuration.</p>
<ul>
<li>Did not fly. Not even close.</li>
<li>I have a feeling that there is just not enough thrust.</li>
<li>It, ahem, landed without anything important breaking …</li></ul></p>
