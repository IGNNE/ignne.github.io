<h1>The Scrap Drone</h1>
<h2 id="what-is-this">What is this?</h2>
<p>This is my attempt to make a “drone” / RC plane / UAV from scratch. I challenged myself to build something that works with almost zero experience in building RC vehicles, let alone planes. It started as a small hobby project for a few boring weekends, but, as they usually do, things got out of hand, and I decided I might as well write it all down somewhere. So expect a lot of try and error and even more duct tape ;)</p>

<p><a href="/current-build-and-background.html">On this page, you will find the most recent setup with a bit of background.</a></p>
<p><a href="/scrap-drone-history.html">For the history and all previous <del>failures</del> setups, click here.</a></p>
<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<ul>
<li>It flies.</li>
<li>It’s cheap and uses as many parts I already have as possible.</li>
<li>Bonus points for video transmission and some autopilot functionality.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, in September 2021, after almost one year, I can finally say that I’ve met all of those, and then some. I went down several rabbit holes, learned some things I never thought about, and overall had lots of fun. Although, I’m not sure if I would do it again; there is only so much engineering fun you can squeeze into the make part of make-or-buy, and sometimes, the journey is, in fact, less interesting than the destination.</p>

<p>Done reading? Wow. Come back later for more updates.</p>
