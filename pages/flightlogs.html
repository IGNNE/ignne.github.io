<h1>Flightlogs</h1>
<h2 id="flight-logs">Flight Logs</h2>
<p>Here are the flight logs, oldest to newest. This means you can follow my struggles in a chronological order. Or, if you are looking for the newest one, just scroll to the bottom. <a href="/pages/scrap-drone.html">Click here</a> to go back to the main page.</p>
<h3 id="first-flight-14.04.21">First “Flight”, 14.04.21</h3>
<p>Around 4°C, a little bit of wind. This flight was done without the barometer, using the simple sensor fusion module. This was the oldest configuration.</p>
<ul>
<li>Did not fly. Not even close.</li>
<li>I have a feeling that there is just not enough thrust.</li>
<li>It, ahem, landed without anything important breaking. That’s something.</li>
<li>It’s really hard to start it when you use a pretty heavy tablet instead of a proper remote control. I think I should borrow a gamepad from a friend or something.</li>
<li>The radio link works better outside than in the city with all the WiFi and noise (who would have thought).</li>
<li>Gyro stabilization seems to work to some degree, it did not oscillate during its 3s of flight. It didn’t do much except crashing anyway, but it crashed in a stable way.</li>
<li>After getting back home, I found out that the ailerons are seen as backwards by the controller. I should probably fix that.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="second-flight-15.04.21">Second “Flight”, 15.04.21</h3>
<p>Slightly warmer, almost no wind. This time with the barometer. Still no flying. Here, have a pretty sunset instead. Same configuration as the first flight.</p>
<p><img src="/images/sunset.png" style="width:70.0%"/></p>
<p>Anyway, a negative result is a result as well. At least I have a reason to go outside in these weird times.</p>
<ul>
<li>Talked to a random cyclist who used to fly RC planes himself. Some really nice advice.</li>
<li>I think at this point, I can’t deny that the motor is too weak any more.</li>
<li>I’ll try to increase the maximum PWM value. I’m stretching the limits of the electronics here, but at least it will have a lot of cooling air flow :)</li>
<li>Maybe I could move the center of gravity back.</li>
<li>I also broke a part of the backbone in a crash, but I hope I can just glue it back on. Maybe I should reinforce that part, balsa wood is weaker than I thought.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="third-flight-17.04.21">Third “Flight”, 17.04.21</h3>
<p>I glued everything together, it seems to work so far. I also moved back the CG and tuned the PWM frequency and max value. I didn’t measure it, but I think I’m around 3-4 A at 5 V, which really is the limit for, well, pretty much everything. This would give me a thrust-to-weight ratio of around 60 W/kg, which should just barely be enough for a slow flyer. I also estimated the speed it needs to generate lift (by running around with the plane in my hand), and I think that at 10+ km/h I should be well flying.</p>
<p>Sadly, it did not really fly. But! It almost did, and it stayed in the air for around 5 seconds! It also <del>crashed</del> landed a lot smoother. The video recording unfortunately decided not to record anything this time, maybe because my laptop had some issues. But the telemetry logging did record, so I analyzed it using the <a href="https://plot.ardupilot.org/">Ardupilot website</a> – interestingly, the <a href="https://logs.px4.io/">PX4 website</a> doesn’t take TLOG files:</p>
<p><img src="/images/flight3.png" style="width:70.0%"/></p>
<p>Maybe I’m interpreting too much into it, but it clearly shows that I was not just doing an assisted crash this time. I also remember trying to pull up the nose mid-flight.</p>
<p>I have a growing suspicion that the motor/prop I’m using is to blame for the bad performance. It does move a lot of air, and it has a static thrust of maybe around 30-50 g, but it came from a quad copter that mainly just hovered around. I don’t have any evidence, but I think the air velocity (effectiveness when in moving air? I have no idea, I’m an IT/EE guy ¯\_(ツ)_/¯) is quite low. Or, to put it the other way around, the people who put it together never thought it would move at more than a few m/s. If this turns out to be true, I might have a problem.</p>
<p>Anyway, the way forward is pretty obvious: More Power!</p>
<p>Maybe I can chain a MOSFET after the motor driver, as some kind of ghetto Darlington circuit. Let’s see what I find in my “misc electronics” box.</p>
<p>Update on the MOSFET idea: Yes, it <em>kind of</em> works. But the motor does not like 20 W. Also, whenever I plug in the motor now, my rudder and elevator servo decide to move on their own. Looks like I built an antenna. I could probably work around that, but I’m starting to lose patience with this whole powertrain. Also, the MOSFET would probably use a heat sink, and those tend to be heavy. I decided to get a whole new powertrain, <a href="#adding-better-actuators">see here for details</a>.</p>
<h3 id="fourth-flight-30.04.21">Fourth Flight, 30.04.21</h3>
<p>The first flight with the new motor, and the first one I can call a flight without quotation marks!</p>
<p><img src="/images/plane-outside.png" style="width:70.0%"/></p>
<p>Sadly, the video recording bugged out again. For the last flight, I switched to just recording the laptop screen, but then the video <em>transmission</em> died. I guess fate doesn’t want me to show a video here, sorry. Here is the result of the screen recording:</p>
<p><video controls="" src="/images/flug-cut.mp4" style="width:70.0%"><a href="/images/flug-cut.mp4">Video</a></video></p>
<p>Also, the last <del>crash</del> landing of the day broke the backbone, of course right <em>behind</em> the part that I strengthened for the new motor. If any real bones ever look like the thing in the picture, go call a doctor.</p>
<p><img src="/images/plane-broken.png" style="width:30.0%"/></p>
<p>Apart from that minor setback, I am going to call this a partial success. It (finally) flies, but it also showed some issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>I made a few short flights, with the longest consisting of several rather large laps around the meadow. It obviously works.</li>
<li>The new power train provides more than enough thrust. I think it uses about 40 W at full throttle, and the battery went from 4,1 V / cell to only around 3,9 V / cell in roughly 30 minutes of testing (in other words, lots of energy left).</li>
<li>With all the new weight, the required airspeed to avoid stalls seems to be quite high. I don’t know how accurate the speed estimation from the IMU is, but from my gut feeling, it needs maybe 20-25 km/h to stay controllable.</li>
<li>I borrowed an XBox controller from a friend, which works surprisingly well. I believe it would have been almost impossible to control the plane with only the touch screen controls.</li>
<li>The plane is really hard to control without IMU stabilization. The one time that I tried to steer it in manual mode was a constant struggle to avoid crashing. I have a few theories:</li>
<li>First, the airframe is not made with high stability in mind. There are vibrations, it can twist quite a bit, and I think I need to “calibrate” the weight and drag a bit more (it constantly pulled to one side).</li>
<li>The WifiBroadcast transmission does not work too well. I feel like everything worked better at the beginning and got worse over time, so maybe it just caught some water. But in the one partial video I could recover, you can see that the attitude updates stutter <em>a lot</em>. This, combined with the first point, makes it pretty hard to appropriately compensate for wind gusts and non-ideal weight distribution.</li>
<li>I am not 100% happy with the IMU, too. I might have to tune the low-pass filters or something.</li>
<li><em>By the way, did I tell you that I have never really flown an RC plane or multicopter before?</em></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fifth-flight-19.09.21">Fifth Flight, 19.09.21</h3>
<p><img src="/images/airview.png" style="width:70.0%"/></p>
<ul>
<li>After the crash in flight number 4, I replaced the whole backbone with a more durable spruce bar, which brought the weight up quite a bit. Despite this, it now flies way more stable.</li>
<li>The new wifi setup is a lot better. It feels way more responsive, and I had a range of several hundred meters. When I stretched the limits, I could feel it drop some data at a certain point, but I could safely steer it back.</li>
<li>I’m not sure if the rigid backbone or the wifi improvement made it so much better, but I guess both. For the first time, I did not struggle to keep it in the air, and could even experiment a bit.</li>
<li>My experience so far: It climbs reasonably decent and it can fly level without too much elevator at around half throttle (I’m using the “trigger axis” of the controller for throttle, so it’s hard to see without looking, but the log seems to confirm this).</li>
<li>I have barely touched the rudder, using the ailerons and a bit of elevator makes the plane turn just fine. It feels a bit “stiff”, probably because of the stabilization. I’ll retry in manual mode soon.</li>
<li>The plane needs quite some speed to keep its new weight in the air, so it doesn’t glide that good. But it can still glide, if it has to, just keep the nose pointed down and the airspeed high.</li>
<li>In the video recording, the barometer shows some random numbers, but in the telemetry, it looks fine. To be investigated.</li>
<li>As is custom, the last flight broke the motor off the backbone. I intentionally used balsa wood here, so the wood would break before anything expensive does. All in all, I’m really happy with its performance. F yeah, it flies!</li>
