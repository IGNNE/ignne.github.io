		<p>Around 4°C, a little bit of wind. This flight was done without the
barometer, using the simple sensor fusion module. This was the oldest
configuration.</p>
<ul>
<li>Did not fly. Not even close.</li>
<li>I have a feeling that there is just not enough thrust.</li>
<li>It, ahem, landed without anything important breaking. That’s
something.</li>
<li>It’s really hard to start it when you use a pretty heavy tablet
instead of a proper remote control. I think I should borrow a gamepad
from a friend or something.</li>
<li>The radio link works better outside than in the city with all the
WiFi and noise (who would have thought).</li>
<li>Gyro stabilization seems to work to some degree, it did not
oscillate during its 3s of flight. It didn’t do much except crashing
anyway, but it crashed in a stable way.</li>
<li>After getting back home, I found out that the ailerons are seen as
backwards by the controller. I should probably fix that.</li>
</ul>
