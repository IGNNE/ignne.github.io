		<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>For various reasons, I own a couple of very different audio /
headphone outputs (“ADCs”). After one evening, where I dove too deep
into the rabbit hole of audio quality, I decided I should just go and
measure them.</p>
<p>To be absolutely clear: I have no idea what I’m doing. I have
successfully ruined my ears with a combination of Rock, Techno and video
games (and I would do it again). I do, however, technically own a
related degree, and although I admit I kind of wriggled my way through
signal theory, this should not be too hard to pull off.</p>
<p>To make it easy to expand this section, each device I test will get
an article of its own.</p>
<h2 id="test-methods">Test Methods</h2>
<p>Simple for now: 12 kHz sine wave, 0.9 amplitude (generated with
Audacity). 48 kHz sample rate everywhere, so no resampling.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.embeddedartists.com/products/labtool/">Labtool</a>
logic analyzer/oscilloscope with a no-name 1x test probe (not that it
should matter, we’re talking audio frequencies here), 200kHz sampling,
adjusted to about 50% amplitude.</p>
<p>No load, measured with a standard 3.5 mm “aux cable” simply clipped
to the probe / ground. All devices adjusted to loud, but still
comfortable headphone level using a run-of-the-mill pair of
headphones.</p>
<p>FFT over one whole data set (around 300 ms), Hamming window,
converted to decibel. Reference value is always the highest peak in the
fft; for the null measurement, it’s the peak from the 12 kHz test.</p>
<p>Generally crowded desk, laptop charging via USB-C dock, two monitors
and lots of cheap cables around. This is aimed at real world
performance, not some kind of test bench values.</p>
