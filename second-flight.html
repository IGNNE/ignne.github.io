<ul>
<li>Talked to a random cyclist who used to fly RC planes himself. Some really nice advice.</li>
<li>I think at this point, I can’t deny that the motor is too weak any more.</li>
<li>I’ll try to increase the maximum PWM value. I’m stretching the limits of the electronics here, but at least it will have a lot of cooling air flow :)</li>
<li>Maybe I could move the center of gravity back.</li>
<li>I also broke a part of the backbone in a crash, but I hope I can just glue it back on. Maybe I should reinforce that part, balsa wood is weaker than I thought.</li>
