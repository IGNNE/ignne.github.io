		<p>Äcktshually the second flight in 2022, I was just to lazy to write two articles. Nice weather. Here’s a short clip:</p>
<p><video controls="" src="/images/flug2202-cut.mp4" style="width:70.0%"><a href="/images/flug2202-cut.mp4">Video</a></video></p>
<p>Main takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>With everything screwed in place and properly set up, stabilization is rock solid. It feels like flying on rails. On one flight, I broke the tail fin and did not even notice it.</li>
<li>Tried a GPS (‘SIM28’). It can’t get / hold a fix. No idea why, maybe interference with the motor? Sucks.</li>
<li>Tried new wifi transmitter on drone side (generic RTL8812AU I found for cheap). Better, but I feel like I need to tweak its position. Drops in the video, likely from bad position and highly directional antenna.</li>
<li>Wing now has carbon backbone and additional strengthening. Now everything else will break first.</li>
<li>With all the strengthening, weight is now quite high (~500-600g?). It flies okay, but it does not want to climb. I have a feeling that the angle of attack of the wing is too low.</li>
<li>With the high weight, I think I will need a landing gear. To be investigated.</li>
</ul>
